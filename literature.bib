  abstract = {A blockchain is a distributed ledger for recording transactions, maintained by many nodes without central authority through a distributed cryptographic protocol. All nodes validate the information to be appended to the blockchain, and a consensus protocol ensures that the nodes agree on a unique order in which entries are appended. Consensus protocols for tolerating Byzantine faults have received renewed attention because they also address blockchain systems. This work discusses the process of assessing and gaining confidence in the resilience of a consensus protocols exposed to faults and adversarial nodes. We advocate to follow the established practice in cryptography and computer security, relying on public reviews, detailed models, and formal proofs; the designers of several practical systems appear to be unaware of this. Moreover, we review the consensus protocols in some prominent permissioned blockchain platforms with respect to their fault models and resilience against attacks. The protocol comparison covers Hyperledger Fabric, Tendermint, Symbiont, R3\textasciitilde{}Corda, Iroha, Kadena, Chain, Quorum, MultiChain, Sawtooth Lake, Ripple, Stellar, and IOTA.},

  abstract = {The blockchain emerges as an innovative tool that has the potential to positively impact the way we design a number of online applications today. In many ways, the blockchain technology is, however, still not mature enough to cater for industrial standards. Namely, existing Byzantine tolerant permission-based blockchain deployments can only scale to a limited number of nodes. These systems typically require that all transactions (and their order of execution) are publicly available to all nodes in the system, which comes at odds with common data sharing practices in the industry, and prevents a centralized regulator from overseeing the full blockchain system. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain architecture devised specifically to meet industrial standards. Our proposal leverages the notion of satellite chains that can privately run different consensus protocols in parallel - thereby considerably boosting the scalability premises of the system. Our solution also accounts for a hands-off regulator that oversees the entire network, enforces specific policies by means of smart contracts, etc. We implemented our solution and integrated it with Hyperledger Fabric v0.6.},

  abstract = {Blockchain, the core mechanism in Bitcoin, has received extensive attentions recently. Blockchain serves as a public ledger and transactions stored in blockchain are nearly impossible to tamper. Blockchain has the key characteristics such as decentralization, persistency, anonymity and auditability. Blockchain help to improve efficiency and security. It could be applied into many fields including financial services, reputation system and public services. However, there are still a large number of technical challenges prohibiting the wide application of blockchain: scalability problem, privacy leakage etc. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on blockchain technology. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art research efforts on blockchain technology. In particular, we first give an overview on blockchain technology. The typical blockchain consensus algorithms are then introduced. We next present a survey on blockchain applications and technical challenges as well as recent advances. Finally, future research directions are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Blockchain is being praised as a technological innovation which allows to revolutionize how society trades and interacts. This reputation is in particular attributable to its properties of allowing mutually mistrusting entities to exchange financial value and interact without relying on a trusted third party. A blockchain moreover provides an integrity protected data storage and allows to provide process transparency.

In this article we critically analyze whether a blockchain is indeed the appropriate technical solution for a particular application scenario. We differentiate between permissionless (e.g., Bitcoin/Ethereum) and permissioned (e.g. Hyperledger/Corda) blockchains and contrast their properties to those of a centrally managed database. We provide a structured methodology to determine the appropriate technical solution to solve a particular application problem. Given our methodology, we analyze in depth three use cases --- Supply Chain Management, Interbank and International Payments, and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and conclude the article with an outlook for further opportunities.},

  shorttitle = {{{PBFT}} vs Proof-of-Authority},
  abstract = {Permissioned blockchains are arising as a solution to federate companies prompting accountable interactions. A variety of consensus algorithms for such blockchains have been proposed, each of which has dierent benets and drawbacks. Proof-of-Authority (PoA) is a new family of BFT consensus algorithms largely used in practice which ensure better performance than well-established PBFT one. However, the lack of adequate analysis on PoA hinders any cautious evaluation of their effectiveness in a real-world setting where permissioned blockchains are deployed over the Internet, hence on eventually synchronous network, and with Byzantine nodes.

In this paper, we analyse two of the main PoA algorithms, named Aura and Clique, both in terms of provided guarantees and performances. First, we derive their functioning including how messages are exchanged, then we weight, by relying on the CAP theorem, consistency, availability and partition tolerance guarantees. We also report a qualitative latency analysis based on message rounds. The analysis advocates that PoA for permissioned blockchains, deployed over WANs experimenting Byzantine nodes, do not provide adequate consistency guarantees for scenarios where data integrity is essential. We claim that PBFT can t better such scenarios, despite a limited loss in terms of performance.},

With the advent of new possibilities in blockchain technology, researchers are keen to find a well-optimized Byzantine fault tolerant consensus protocol. Creating a global consensus protocol or tailoring a cross-platform plug and play software application for implementation of various consensus protocols are ideas of huge interest. Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) is considered to be a global consensus protocol and promises to be Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) by bringing with it the concept of quorum slices and federated byzantine fault tolerance. This consensus's working and its comparison with other protocols that were earlier proposed are analyzed here. Also, hyperledger an open-source project by Linux Foundation which includes implementing the concept of practical byzantine fault tolerance and also a platform where various other consensus protocols and blockchain applications can be deployed in a plug and play manner is also being discussed here. This paper focuses on analyzing these consensus protocols already proposed and their feasibility and efficiency in meeting the characteristics they propose to provide.},

  title = {The Role of Trust in Understanding the Effects of Blockchain on Business Models},
  abstract = {Blockchain technology is a systemic transaction innovation in information processing. It enables trust-reliant transactions between parties that were previously unable to trust each other by means of an immutable transaction log and verification of order and validity of transactions, among other things.  Blockchain technology is a new way to integrate old technologies, such as digital signatures, cryptography, and hash functions, but as an innovation it is just at the start of its evolution. This is an important topic to study, for it is still poorly understood, but anticipated to be a disruptive technological innovation. This work studies how blockchain technology could change business models, and especially what is the role of trust in this change. The theoretical frame for this study comes from trust literature. 
 
This study started with a literature review, based on which two hypotheses were created that were tested with a comparative case study of two companies, one from energy and one from financial services industry. The primary material was collected from 25 interviews, each lasting for about an hour. In addition to the two case companies, the sample included experts from the industries and blockchain specialists. Based on the interviews and other material, I constructed three hypothetical use cases that both illustrate how blockchain technology can be used and present an opportunity for analysis of business models.  
 
The most important conclusions of this study divide into two. First of all, the research clarifies the strategic understanding of blockchain technology by presenting a framework for use case evaluation and by opening the opportunity offered by blockchain to increase trust or to negate the need for it in a transaction. Secondly, this study offers implications both for companies and for further study, indicating that blockchain use cases are very difficult to find. Further, the role of trust in an industry seems to have an effect on what kinds of changes blockchain can cause in business models. Blockchain technology can thus be considered both a technological and a business model innovation, and making a distinction between the two is important. As a business model innovation, blockchain could disrupt business models in a wide range of industries and geographical locations.},

However, another, arguably more important, part of the Bitcoin experiment is the underlying blockchain technology as a tool of distributed consensus, and attention is rapidly starting to shift to this other aspect of Bitcoin. Commonly cited alternative applications of blockchain technology include using on-blockchain digital assets to represent custom currencies and financial instruments (colored coins),[3] the ownership of an underlying physical device (smart property),[4] non-fungible assets such as domain names (Namecoin),[5] as well as more complex applications involving having digital assets being directly controlled by a piece of code implementing arbitrary rules known as smart contracts[6] or even blockchain-based decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).[7] What Ethereum intends to provide is a blockchain with a built-in fully fledged Turing-complete programming language that can be used to create "contracts" that can be used to encode arbitrary state transition functions, allowing users to create any of the systems described above, as well as many others that we have not yet imagined, simply by writing up the logic in a few lines of code.},

A key property of HLF is its extensibility, and in particular the support for multiple ordering services for building the blockchain. Nonetheless, the version 1.0 was launched in early 2017 without an implementation of a Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) ordering service. To overcome this limitation, we designed, implemented, and evaluated a BFT ordering service for HLF on top of the BFT-SMaRt state machine replication/consensus library, implementing also optimizations for wide-area deployment. Our results show that HLF with our ordering service can achieve up to ten thousand transactions per second and write a transaction irrevocably in the blockchain in half a second, even with peers spread in different continents.},

  abstract = {Summary form only given. Strong light-matter coupling has been recently successfully explored in the GHz and THz [1] range with on-chip platforms. New and intriguing quantum optical phenomena have been predicted in the ultrastrong coupling regime [2], when the coupling strength $\Omega$ becomes comparable to the unperturbed frequency of the system $\omega$. We recently proposed a new experimental platform where we couple the inter-Landau level transition of an high-mobility 2DEG to the highly subwavelength photonic mode of an LC meta-atom [3] showing very large $\Omega$/$\omega$c = 0.87. Our system benefits from the collective enhancement of the light-matter coupling which comes from the scaling of the coupling $\Omega$ $\propto$ $\surd$n, were n is the number of optically active electrons. In our previous experiments [3] and in literature [4] this number varies from 104-103 electrons per meta-atom. We now engineer a new cavity, resonant at 290 GHz, with an extremely reduced effective mode surface Seff = 4 \texttimes{} 10-14 m2 (FE simulations, CST), yielding large field enhancements above 1500 and allowing to enter the few ($<$;100) electron regime. It consist of a complementary metasurface with two very sharp metallic tips separated by a 60 nm gap (Fig.1(a, b)) on top of a single triangular quantum well. THz-TDS transmission experiments as a function of the applied magnetic field reveal strong anticrossing of the cavity mode with linear cyclotron dispersion. Measurements for arrays of only 12 cavities are reported in Fig.1(c). On the top horizontal axis we report the number of electrons occupying the topmost Landau level as a function of the magnetic field. At the anticrossing field of B=0.73 T we measure approximately 60 electrons ultra strongly coupled ($\Omega$/$\omega$- ||},

From a security standpoint, the article highlights how blockchain-based solutions could be, in many aspects, superior to the current IoT ecosystem, which relies mainly on centralized cloud servers. Using practical applications and real-world examples, the article argues that blockchain's decentralized nature is likely to result in a low susceptibility to manipulation and forgery by malicious participants. Special consideration is given to how blockchain-based identity and access management systems can address some of the key challenges associated with IoT security. The column provides a detailed analysis and description of blockchain's roles in tracking the sources of insecurity in supply chains related to IoT devices. Using blockchain, it is also possible to contain an IoT security breach in a targeted way after it is discovered.

A number of large industrial players, such as IBM, Microsoft, Intel, and NEC, are currently investing in exploiting the blockchain in order to enrich their portfolio of products. A number of researchers and practitioners speculate that the blockchain technology can change the way we see a number of online applications today. Although it is still early to tell for sure, it is expected that the blockchain will stimulate considerable changes to a large number of products and will positively impact the digital experience of many individuals around the globe. In this tutorial, we overview, detail, and analyze the security provisions of Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain-effectively capturing recently reported attacks and threats in the system. Our contributions go beyond the mere analysis of reported vulnerabilities of Bitcoin; namely, we describe and evaluate a number of countermeasures to deter threats on the system-some of which have already been incorporated in the system. Recall that Bitcoin has been forked multiple times in order to fine-tune the consensus (i.e., the block generation time and the hash function), and the network parameters (e.g., the size of blocks). As such, the results reported in this tutorial are not only restricted to Bitcoin, but equally apply to a number of "altcoins" which are basically clones/forks of the Bitcoin source code. Given the increasing number of alternative blockchain proposals, this tutorial extracts the basic security lessons learnt from the Bitcoin system with the aim to foster better designs and analysis of next-generation secure blockchain currencies and technologies.},

  title = {Roadblocks of {{Blockchain}}},
  abstract = {By Joaquin Moreno, Blockchain Practice Lead \textendash{} Globant Although blockchain technology is in its infant stage, there are several challenges that will need to be addressed. This article features six challenges the industry is facing in order to push blockchain technology towards a more mainstream adoption. 1) Regulation: Regulation impacts the direction that industry moves. Therefore, it is critical to understand how regulatory institutions are going to react to blockchain technology. We are starting to see the first movements on this topic. Some countries and states have taken the first step in creating a favorable regulatory environment for these technologies, however there is still a lot of work that remains. Bitcoin is viewed as ``a bad word'' for regulators, but if you look closer, the traceability of bitcoin is a feature that security agencies have been dreaming about for the last few decades. Therefore, how bad can it be at the end of the day? How will these technologies (transactions and smart contracts) be regulated? Where is the line going to be drawn? These questions are still unanswered, and it seems that it will take some time to have an answer. 2) Scalability: Current blockchain technologies allow a discreet amount of transactions per second. Within the below image, you will find a comparison between Bitcoin, Ethereum, Paypal, and Visa. Image 1: Transactions per seconds on public blockchain vs Paypal vs Visa There is still a lot of work to done in this space in order to get closer to the current transactionals solution on the market. 3) Privacy: For this topic, we need to differentiate between the two kinds of blockchains: a private and a public. Privacy is important in both cases. With the public blockchain, we need to be very careful about the information we want to publish, as anyone can have access to it. There are some cryptographic techniques that have been developed which allow you to store encrypted data and be the only person to access it. The question is, should the stored data be visible to a certain type of user? Currently, there is no answer to this question. For private blockchains, the problem is the same. Let's suppose that you and I are members of a group of banks and we want to use a private blockchain. If I send you some information, would I want the other banks to see that information? 4) Storage: The blockchains currently on the market are not able to store much information; they cannot even store a 3MB .pdf file. If you need to store more information, there should be a way to connect the blockchain with a storage system. There are some distributed systems under development like Storj.io and IPFS (Inter Planetary File System) which help store information and keep the security levels offered by a blockchain. 5) Standards: In order for a technology to be massively implemented it requires compliance or adherence to certain basic standards or framework. The question here is: do industry leaders and companies want to set the standards within the innovation space opened by this new technology? If yes, will the standard be developed as fast as the innovation goes? In my opinion, \ldots{}},
